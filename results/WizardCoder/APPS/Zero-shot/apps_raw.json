First we create an empty dictionary `freq` to store the frequency of each element in the array.\r\n2. We iterate over the array and update its frequency count in the dictionary for each element.\r\n3. For each key-value pair in the dictionary, if the value is greater than or equal to 2, we add all possible pairs of indices with that element to the `count` variable, considering the constraint $i < j < k$ (because $k > i$ and $l > j$). We do this by using a formula for the sum of the first $n$ natural numbers: $\\frac{n(n+1)}{2}$.\r\n4. Finally we divide `count` by 2 because we count each pair twice (once in each order).\r\n5. For example, if there are two elements that appear twice, then we add 6 to the result, but we counted each pair twice: $(1,2)$ and $(2,1)$, so we need to divide it by 2.\r\n\r\nThe time complexity of this solution is $O(n \\log n)$, because we iterate over the array once and over the dictionary (which has at most $n$ elements) in constant time for each element. The space complexity is also $O(n)$. ",
    "18": "To solve this problem, we need to find the maximum possible perimeter of the given $2n$-gon and then square it to get the minimum side length of the required square. We can use Heron's formula for calculating the perimeter of a regular polygon with $n$ sides as $\\sqrt{n(a^2+b^2-c^2-d^2)$, where $a$, $b$, and $c$ are the lengths of two adjacent sides, and $d$ is the length of the side shared by all the vertices.

If this is less than `k`, we need to buy all `k` shows.\r\n- Otherwise, we return the minimum between `k-count` and `count`. This means that if there are more shows with at least one episode on `d` consecutive days than there are shows in total (which may not be possible), we only need to buy `k-count` shows to have the option to watch all episodes of these shows.\r\n\r\nNote: The time complexity of this code is O(n) and the space complexity is O(k).

If the temperature is not within its preferred range at that time, we break out of the loop with \"NO\"\r\n- We then calculate the final temperature after all the reservations have been handled (`for t, l, h in reservations`).\r\n- We start by checking if `t` is greater than 1 and outside the current temperature bounds (meaning that we need to change the state of the air conditioner). If it is, then we break out with \"NO\". \r\n- Otherwise, we check if the temperature is currently outside of a reservation's preferred range. We handle cases where the reservation time is 0 or 1 separately (since there are no changes to make in those cases), and for all other times, we simulate the air conditioner going off at even minutes and on at odd minutes.\r\n- If the temperature is within a reservation's preferred range, we update it accordingly. \r\n- Finally, we check if all reservations were satisfied by checking the value of `satisfied` (which defaults to True). If any reservation was not satisfied, we set it to False and break out.\r\n\r\nThis solution has a time complexity of O(n*t), where n is the number of reservations and t is the maximum time for any reservation. Since this code doesn't handle large values of `q` or `t`, it should be efficient enough for most inputs. ",

Otherwise, we connect i to all j such that it takes m_j coins to get i's vote.\r\n\r\nThe `min_coins` function creates the graph and calls `dijkstra`.

It does this by counting its occurrences and checking if it's equal to 1.\r\n- We read input T, the number of test cases, and loop through each one. For each test case we check whether there is exactly one occurrence of \"abacaba\" using `is_valid` function.\r\n- If yes, then we generate all possible combinations of lowercase English letters for question marks using `itertools.product`, which returns an iterator that produces all the possible permutations of a given length (in this case, the number of occurrences of '?' in `s`).\r\n- For each combination, we replace every occurrence of '?' with one letter from the generated combination and check if there is exactly one occurrence of \"abacaba\" as a substring using `is_valid` function. If so, we print it.\r\n- If not, we output \"No\". ",
    "29": "Here's a Python code that solves the problem:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfor _ in range(int(input())):\r\n    n = int(input())\r\n    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))\r\n    ans = [-1] * (n+1)\r\n    for k in range(1, n+1):\r\n        d = {}\r\n        for i in range(0, n-k+1):\r\n            subarr = arr[i:i+k]\r\n            d[min(subarr)] = True\r\n        if len(d) == k:\r\n            ans[k] = min(d)\r\n    print(*ans)\r\n```\r\n\r\nExplanation:\r\n\r\nWe iterate over all possible values of $k$ from 1 to $n$, and for each value we create a dictionary `d` that will store the minimum number occurring in all subarrays of length $k$. We then check if the number of keys in `d` is equal to $k$, which means that every integer from 1 to k occurs in at least one subarray of length $k$. If it does, we assign that minimum value to the $k$-th index of `ans`. Otherwise, we leave it as -1. Finally, we print out the result for each test case.\r\n\r\nTime complexity: O(n^2)\r\n\r\nSpace complexity: O(n) "
