    "0": "To group strings by their length, we can use a dictionary where the keys are the unique string lengths and the values are lists of strings with those lengths. The idea is to iterate through the list of strings, check the length of each string, and add it to the appropriate list in the dictionary.\n\nHere is the implementation of the function 'group_strings_by_length':\n\n```python\ndef group_strings_by_length(strings):\n    grouped_strings = {}\n\n    for string in strings:\n        length = len(string)\n        if length not in grouped_strings:\n            grouped_strings[length] = []\n        grouped_strings[length].append(string)\n\n    return grouped_strings\n```\n\nThis function takes a list of strings as input and returns a dictionary where the keys are the unique string lengths and the values are lists of strings with those lengths. The function iterates through each string in the list, checks its length, and adds it to the appropriate list in the dictionary. If the length is not already in the dictionary, a new list is created for it."
