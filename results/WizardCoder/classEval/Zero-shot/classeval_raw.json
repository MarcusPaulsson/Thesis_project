    "0": "\nYou can assume that you will be playing against an AI opponent, and the board size is 10x10. The ship locations are randomly generated. You need to place your ships before the game starts. Your ships can be placed horizontally or vertically. The game starts when both players have placed all their ships and it is each player's turn to shoot at the other player's ships. Each shot should be a guess of a coordinate (x,y) on the opponent's board. If you hit, output \"Hit!\", if you miss, output \"Miss!\" If you sink a ship, output \"Sunk!\" and mark it on the grid.\nHere is an example of how the game could work:\n\n1. Place your ships (5 ships, 4 long, 3 medium, 2 short)\n   | -------|-----------------|\n   |        |                 |\n   |     |---------------|   |\n   |                      |   |\n   |              |--------|   |\n   |                      |   |\n   |             |----------|  |\n   |                      |   |\n   |               |-----|   |\n   |                      |   |\n   |        |-------------|   |\n   |                      |   |\n    -------------------------\n2. Your opponent places their ships randomly\n3. Take turns shooting at each other's board until one player sinks all their ships or runs out of shots\n4. Game over, show the final state of both boards and declare a winner. "
