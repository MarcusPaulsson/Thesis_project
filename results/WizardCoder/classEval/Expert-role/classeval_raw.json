It helps prevent the spread of germs, bacteria, and viruses that can cause disease. In this program, we need to prompt the user to enter their age and gender, and then display an appropriate message based on their age and gender. If they are below 18 years old, they must wash for at least 20 seconds. If they are above 18 but less than 65, they can skip handwashing altogether. For those aged between 65 and 74, they must dry their hands with soap after use before continuing with any activity. Finally, for anyone over 74 years old, they must wash their hands thoroughly for at least 20 seconds before and after using the toilet or touching any surface.\n\nHere's a Python program snippet that demonstrates this:\r\n\r\n\r\n```python\r\n# Prompt user for age and gender input\r\nage = int(input(\"Please enter your age: \"))\r\ngender = input(\"Please enter your gender (M/F): \")\r\n\r\nif gender == 'M':\r\n    if age < 18:\r\n        print(\"You must wash for at least 20 seconds before and after using the toilet or touching any surface.\")\r\n    elif age >= 65:\r\n        print(\"Please dry your hands with soap before continuing with any activity\")\r\n    else:\r\n        print(\"Handwashing is not required for you.\")\r\nelif gender == 'F':\r\n    if age < 18:\r\n        print(\"You must wash for at least 20 seconds before and after using the toilet or touching any surface.\")\r\n    elif age >= 65:\r\n        print(\"Please dry your hands with soap before continuing with any activity\")\r\n    else:\r\n        print(\"Handwashing is not required for you.\")\r\nelse:\r\n    print(\"Invalid input. Please enter 'M' or 'F'.\")\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote: In case of invalid input, the program should display an error message and exit gracefully.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can further improve this program by adding a switch/case statement to handle different scenarios for different genders separately. This is just a basic example and can be improved further with more complex control flow logic based on age groups and gender. "
