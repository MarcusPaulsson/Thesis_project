Hmm, I remember that the formula for the area is π multiplied by the radius squared. But wait, what value of π should I use? I think 3.14 is commonly used, but maybe I can make it more accurate. Oh, right, Python has a math module that includes pi, so I should import that.\n\nFirst, I'll need to get the radius from the user. How do I do that? Oh, right, I can use the input() function. But wait, the input is a string, so I need to convert it to a float. So something like radius = float(input(\"Enter the radius: \")). That makes sense.\n\nThen, I'll calculate the area. So area = math.pi * radius ** 2. Oh, right, I have to make sure to use the ** operator for exponentiation.\n\nAfter calculating, I should print the result. Maybe with two decimal places for clarity. So I can use the round function: print(\"The area is\", round(area, 2)). That should make it look neat.\n\nWait, do I need to handle any edge cases? Like if the radius is zero or negative? Well, the problem doesn't specify, so I'll assume the user enters a positive number. But maybe I should add a check. Hmm, but the user might not know, so perhaps it's better to just let it run and let any errors come up naturally.\n\nPutting it all together, I'll need to import math at the beginning. Then, the steps are: get radius, calculate area, print the result.\n\nLet me write the code step by step. First, import math. Then, get the radius. Then compute the area. Then print it with two decimal places.\n\nWait, should I use a variable for the radius? Like radius = float(input(...)). Yeah, that's fine.\n\nLet me test this in my mind. If radius is 5, area should be π*25, which is approximately 78.54. So the code should output something like \"The area is 78.54\".\n\nI think that's it. So the code should be:\n\nimport math\nradius = float(input(\"Enter the radius: \"))\narea = math.pi * radius ** 2\nprint(\"The area is\", round(area, 2))\n\nWait, but sometimes when I print"
