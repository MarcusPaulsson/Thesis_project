To implement Battleship in Python with a command-line interface, we'll create a simple two-player game where each player can input their moves and see the results. Here's a step-by-step guide:

### 1. Create the Game Class
First, define a class to represent the game state.

```python
class Battleship:
    def __init__(self):
        self.game_board = [[True for _ in range(10)] for _ in range(10]]
        self.current_player = 'player1'
        self.game_over = False

    def set_game(self, new_board):
        self.game_board = new_board
        self.game_over = False

    def is_game_over(self):
        return self.game_over or self.game_over

    def get_input(self):
        while True:
            try:
                move = int(input(""Enter your move (row, column): "")) - 1
                if move < 0 or move >= 10:
                    print(""Invalid move"")
                    continue
                break
            except ValueError:
                print(""Please enter a number."")
```

### 2. Initialize the Game
Create an instance of the Battleship class.

```python
game = Battleship()
```

### 3. Main Game Loop
Implement the main loop that handles turns and displays the board.

```python
def handle_turn(self):
    if self.current_player == 'player1':
        print(""Player 1's turn:"")
        while not self.is_game_over():
            move = self.get_input()
            if move == -1:  # Player enters -1 to end
                self.game_board[move][move] = False
                print(f""Ship sunk! {self.count_ships()} hits."")
                self.current_player = 'player2'
                self.game_over = True
                break
            else:
                if self.game_board[move][move]:
                    self.game_board[move][move] = False
                    print(f""{move+1} row, {move+1} col hit!"")
                    self.current_player = 'player2'
                else:
                    self.game_board[move][move] = True
                    print(f""{move+1} row, {move+1} col miss!"")
                    self.current_player = 'player1'
        else:
            print(""Game ended due to invalid move."")

    elif self.current_player == 'player2':
        print(""Player 2's turn:"")
        while not self.is_game_over():
            move = self.get_input()
            if move == -1:  # Player enters -1 to end
                self.game_board[move][move] = False
                print(f""Ship sunk! {self.count_ships()} hits."")
                self.current_player = 'player1'
                self.game_over = True
                break
            else:
                if self.game_board[move][move]:
                    self.game_board[move][move] = False
                    print(f""{move+1} row, {move+1} col hit!"")
                    self.current_player = 'player1'
                else:
                    self.game_board[move][move] = True
                    print(f""{move+1} row, {move+1} col miss!"")
                    self.current_player = 'player2'
        else:
            print(""Game ended due to invalid move."")
```

### 4. Count Ships
Define a method to count the number of ships.

```python
def count_ships(self):
    count = 0
    rows = len(self.game_board)
    cols = len(self.game_board[0])
    for i in range(rows):
        for j in range(cols):
            if self.game_board[i][j]:
                if i > 0 and self.game_board[i-1][j]:
                    count += 1
                    continue
                if j > 0 and self.game_board[i][j-1]:
                    count += 1
                    continue
    return count
```

### 5. Run the Game
Initialize the game and start the main loop.

```python
if __name__ == ""__main__"":
    game = Battleship()
    while not game.game_over:
        game.handle_turn()
```

### Explanation
- **Initialization**: The `Battleship` class is initialized with a 10x10 grid representing the game board. Players take turns entering coordinates until one player sinks all the opponent's ships.
- **Input Handling**: Each player inputs coordinates using the keyboard. If they enter -1, it ends the game immediately.
- **Board Management**: The game board is updated based on whether a coordinate hits a ship or misses.
- **Turn System**: Players alternate turns starting with ""player1"". The current player switches after each successful hit.
- **Game Over Conditions**: The game ends when either player successfully sinking all the opponent's ships or enters an invalid coordinate (-1).

This implementation provides a basic version of Battleship with a command-line interface, allowing players to play against each other or test the game itself.",
